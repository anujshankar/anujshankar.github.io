Among all the array of positive human emotions, one emotion kept under the carpet but each of us, as we face variety of situations are assailed by feelings of grief and also of anger.  These emotions can be very hard to express, for fear of upsetting other people, or making them feel that they somehow have to find a solution to your sadness. Personally, I have always been afraid of anger. I did not realise this until in one of my psychology classes, I identified my reluctance to express or even admit to any kind of angry feelings. There was a lot of anger around several issues. I think what was almost worse than the anger was the threat of it. Something would upset the balance in the family home, and we would then all play a collective waiting game: would the emotions dissipate, or would they erupt into something much more terrible and destructive? 

Anger always lay at the origin of these explosions of emotion, and much time and thought therefore needed to be dedicated to its avoidance. Most often on the receiving end of my parents’ anger, I failed to recognise my own, and certainly did not express it. Rather, I subconsciously repackaged it as sadness or self-loathing and turned it inwards. 

Over my years while exploring the varsity of spectrum of human emotions, I have come 
to understand that anger can be expressed and that in fact it often needs to be. As Dr Harriet Lerner says that anger is a signal that we should listen to. Feelings of anger might mean that we are being hurt, that our rights are being violated, that our needs are not being met adequately, or that we are not addressing an important emotional issue in our lives. From my own point of view, the first step was acknowledging and accepting that anger was an emotion one could actually feel. In discussions with myself over the nights that clinged onto finding a right path to express anger and to explore the healthy outlets, I would often wonder about being upset, stressed, or in a state of panic.
Frequently, I would reflect these emotional experiences back to me as an expression of my anger, which I sometimes heard in my own voice, even if I was in a state of awareness yet unaware of it. 

Through these years, it became clear that I had come to see anger as a purely negative emotion and one that was to be avoided, largely due  to the sense of threat I associated with it in my childhood, Over time, I have come to understand, as is the case with many emotions, that anger in and of itself is neither good nor bad. Rather, the consequences of anger depend on how a person responds to their emotions.

Anger can be perceived as a negative emotion due to the nature of the external factors that may trigger it, such as bullying, humiliation or loss. Anger can also be caused by internal factors such as frustration or failure.  An outburst of anger may be preceded by negative thought patterns, which can further cement our perception of anger as negative or harmful, and which also illustrate how anger is often less to do with an event and more to do with our personal response to it. 

Anger may result from a process of blaming someone else for negative events or emotions. An individual may seek to attribute blame in order to avoid personal responsibility or a sense of shame, and anger displaces those feelings onto another person. Anger may follow a psychological process of generalisation. 

In moments of stress in particular, we can have a tendency to see things in black and white. We use words like ‘always’ or ‘never’ to describe a situation, with the result of making it seem worse than it actually is, and making our emotional reaction to it more extreme. In other situations, we may keep a mental tally of perceived injustices, which build until we add the final straw. We then erupt in anger that may be experienced by others as an overreaction. If we want to engage with our anger but also manage it and make it more proportionate to events, we need to challenge these negative thought processes.This can be easier said than done, not least when our feelings of anger are so powerful that it is difficult to consider them rationally. Holding onto these thoughts, I tried to identify my anger, I felt a loss of emotional control.

My interactions with people around me - in particular my family, were often governed by the anger that I suddenly realised I felt, whether or not it related to the moment I was in.
While over time my ability to manage my anger has improved, this remains one of the reasons I find anger such a difficult emotion. I still feel that there is a floodgate holding back a whole tidal wave of feeling. Expressing one’s anger is a huge risk, since the anger of the moment may be overtaken by the anger one have held at bay on countless previous occasions. It is often difficult to identify the precise origins of one’s feelings of anger in any one moment, and in that scenario one feels that both I and my interlocutor are at risk from my emotions. The more one is able to acknowledge and reflect on their anger, the more they are able to find safe ways to express it. However, it is still extremely difficult not to turn one’s anger inwards. 

In particular, I have encountered a tendency in people to think about how dissatisfied they are with their life. Rationally, I can see that angrily blaming oneself for poor choices one has made is self-destructive; angrily blaming a vague notion of Fate or chance creates a sense of hopelessness, which can also lead to self-destructive impulses. Acknowledging one’s anger as an indication that something needs to change, and seeing it as a positive signal that will hopefully enable one to feel a sense of agency in that process of change – ‘I can do things differently’ - helps one to see anger in a different light. I recognise that as an emotion it can be as helpful a signpost to one as other, more conventionally positive feelings. There is still some way to go before one can be completely open with oneself and others about the anger that one feels. However, for some therapy and for others a practice of self exploration would give them the opportunity to acknowledge and express anger in a safe place. As one becomes more honest with themselves about their anger. One notices that expression of anger could be paved through a smooth pathway which doesn’t have to belittled under passivity but rather an emotion which one recognises.
