You know how certain things which while they break, shatter into a million pieces just as silently as one fine day it builds back. Despite located on the left side, why do we still believe it to be right? 

Oh heart, I remember you falling for a person who amidst the crowd felt like a home, speaking a language that you danced on it’s tunes, a boy who wore a grey sweatshirt sculpted greatly for a shelter and also arms that looked as though they were meant for me only. 

Unknowingly I kept your heart safely with me, maybe, only because I wanted it to be shattered into a million pieces. The calm was coming to a slow end, and I was hoping that what I see is just a strong wind but it came as a storm. As you slowly started withdrawing day by day. I kept myself pre-occupied with the notion, that sometimes souls become so weary of each other. That sometimes despite having truckloads of faith and trust, I was ignoring the bells that lingered somewhere in the air that the end was approaching. 

You know how heartbreaks are considered heroic or a blissful trauma that one learns resilience from. But I found myself resistant to this thought. I should have known that despite narrating the stories of my ventricles. I was not yet closer to believe that sometimes people who are gazing are not here to stay. Everytime I stood there blurting “I love you”, only to hear the tunes of my disgraceful words just like how the mountain echoes back. Everytime I ran through your ribcage, only to be satisfied that the heart that was missing is placed deeply under my fissures. I was somewhere missing that while my fingers were stiching a life together with you. You made me believe that each of my thread came to be a little weak to tie you together. 

For what it’s worth, I collided with you one fine day. Only to see how the course would 
change the very next day. You know how beautiful this tale was till the time I was the author. But who knew co-writers existed all along. I fell and then I fell apart. Only this time, the tunes were an ode that I dedicated to you. My therapist called these tunes that have been guiding my other relationships. Maybe I’m wrong or maybe right? 

Yours, <br>
Fair one!
