I want your Monday morning sleep soaked eyes dream drenched voice, lazy bones ‘five more minutes please, baby.’ I want your Tuesday afternoon coffee break, glasses off, laughter on, ‘hold me tight, it’s been a hard day.’ I want your Wednesday evening fingers through hair, neck craning, eye glazing and tired voice that utters that ‘this paperwork never ends’, which sounds almost music to me. I want your Thursday night drinks for two bones, unbind muscles, let loose flats, uttering that “ I want just you and me’. I want your Friday finally stretch soul smile, sun slipping light from the glaciers in your eyes, fingers unfurl, where your voice is sleepy but you are way too excited to listen to my stories. I want your wild, I want your calm. All composed under that interiority of love. I want your weekend, your movie marathon saturday, listening to my poetry, following your playlist. But more than any story, I’m hooked at your gaze. I want your Sunday morning orange juice and pancakes, holding onto each other just to murmur that ‘let’s not get out of bed today’. Just as much as I want your good days, I want your bad days too. I want your drunk voice which makes me weak in the knees, I want your lazy and embrace your lonely. I want that fist full fight that ends up in tickling. Who said love was grand gestures? I want you each day in whatever form you wish to take that day. I want to walk in the corridor and those lifts where standing close to you feels that I walk with home. I want that sleepy voice which fades away in sleep. But still remembers to wish goodnight. I want you everyday in every way for the rest of my life. I want to decorate my life with the monotony of your existence. Because I know if it’s you, it is like your existence sings to me each day. And the tunes as much as it excites me and calm it, I’m hooked at it’s enchantment. People want love stories, I just want a routine decorated with love from you.
