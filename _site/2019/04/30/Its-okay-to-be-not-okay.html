<p>I‚Äôm someone who has read a lot about Depression, Phobia or maybe free floating anxiety that one faces. Intertwined with terminology for such feelings, I have felt a few of them in my life, also have encountered various instances in a hospital setting while busy with my internship experience trying to imbibe everything. I saw a dialectial difference between how at the outset of these definitions. The affective component, cognitive component, physiological component and the social component, everything contributed to this grid of people who fall under such feelings. Some while naming these demons that would be swayed away from shamans, some forced to enter the hospital while reaching at the boundary of maladaptiveness and merely few who recognise these feelings as something that need attention from a proper source. 
Such emotions though hard to acceptance in a social as well within the interiority of oneself. It‚Äôs a feeling that each one of us keep it as a story under our beds of sub-consciousness, a story which is right under our throat but everytime someone merely narrates such feeling, all we are trying to gulp it down more harder. Everyone has faced it and I studying this subject, have been not at the receiving end of a special treatment of not having to do anything with such feelings. A scary place it is, but one message that returns to me each day is - it is okay to be not okay!</p>

<p>We all go through some disturbing phase in life, our ups and downs, no matter who you are. We are always going to have troubles in life and for each of us recognising this is a challenge to almost this feeling leaving us in a vulnerable shell. Sometimes this shell could contain us well for a definite amount of time and sometimes the shell needs repairing. But that doesn‚Äôt meet that the shell was not strong enough, it is our responsibility to feed our shell and repair it each day. It is not because I‚Äôm a student of this discipline, but because I‚Äôm just another person in this world feeling what each one of you must have felt sometime. Maybe my tale is a little different, maybe my affect is placed in a different spectrum that yours, but my story just like any one of yours. Would pave way for understanding what emotions are capable of and what humans who face such emotions are no different to each other.</p>

<p>I think life is full of obstacles and each one of us are fighting our best. One is basically trying to solve one question and get to another question, over and over. That‚Äôs what life is. As we are trying to complicate these questions a little by sometimes not seeking answers by sharing or asking for help- it is becoming more challenging. I know at the bay of vulnerability, one feels a sense of dependence and loss of one‚Äôs control. I have felt that. But what if the illusionary control that we all are seeking is nothing but hiding the tales that might not be heroic in nature but a tale that is truthful enough to the other. Maybe we all are in this voyage, discovering life with various emotions. And maybe somebody who took a different route knows the way better than you do. And maybe just maybe, you are better thorough with the route that he/she might be stepping in.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not asking for a journey of wisdom here, just a journey of acceptance. Being able to encourage the people near you to get the help they need. Maybe certain emotions could be benefitted by sharing with certain friends and maybe this time changing the topic about what you really feel about life rather than just addressing the whereabouts in a socially accepted way. Infact, what is socially accepted anyway? If that conduct, cannot help us all grow together. I want each one of you, the very next time in your lives when a person sits with you and shares or even seems not okay. Rather than hiding away those gulps remind him/her that it is okay to be not okay.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs okay to ask for help, whether it‚Äôs talking to a therapist or going to psychiatrist, whether it‚Äôs talking to your friend or the solace you find in art or nature. It‚Äôs important. I want each one you to realise that Mental Health is important and struggle is real. And no matter how better each one of you hide it, maybe the intensity is different but each one is capable of recognising these emotions. There are a lot of people who are hiding away from it, not recognising that suppression is just the start of the tale to it‚Äôs more uninhibited forms. For me able to save someone‚Äôs life by once recognising that even I have faced certain emotion or maybe leading them towards the right help, is important than a Gold medal. For me maybe, there is no potential that is infinitely greater than helping the other person grow. For me, I cannot settle in telling myself I‚Äôm okay and sometimes others too, as I have realised that it is okay to be not okay.</p>
