<p>I have heard from the elders that life gets easy after you achieve milestones, some people might define these as intermingled with the successful careers, some might find peace in the loved ones that have been watching their back and some might still be finding the milestones. But there are times, when one is walking down that road. Sometimes wandering a little because that path doesn’t excite them anymore, sometimes exploring with caution as they are still unsure that what will the next destination bring and sometimes just a little scared. Because who ever said that growing up brings new experiences and difficulties, forgot to tell us the value of bravery. And most importantly, to accept that one is not brave enough each day but can surpass it.</p>

<p>Entangled amongst the little pavements that we find on each of the road that makes our path, we decorate it with the things that we aspire from life. Amidst that rigmarole, we forget that everyday is not about walking on that road with the brave face, sometimes as one is walking on the sidewalk just gathering courage to step on the road back. One is still brave. Ofcourse, we find bravery as a heroic demeanour that is endearing to the finest human potential. I might add a little to it’s stature, I think each one of you is brave. I think it’s brave when you get up in the morning and construct a road map that you will undertake today even if your soul is weary and your mind is shouting or completely numb from inside.</p>

<p>I think it’s brave when each one of you get up each day, watching the voyage called life and swimming through each hurdle with your effort. I think it’s brave, because each one of us reach a point of giving up and sometimes while there is a complete disequilibrium stopping us. We differ from our homeostasis, not because we don’t believe in one. But because, you’re trying to redefine the boundaries. And no matter where you are in life. If you get up each day whether this time you’re brave enough to walk on the road or the pavement calls you today. Or whether some day, you decide to contribute to the bravery of the other.</p>

<p>I want you to know that after each scary storm, There is brave in each of you.</p>
