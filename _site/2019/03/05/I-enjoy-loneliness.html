<p>It is sometimes scary to see that how comfortable we grow with our loneliness. Sometimes using it as a blanket to shield ourselves from the cold of unknown minds, sometimes encountering a language so foreign in our dear ones that turn us inward into our own shells, sometimes in the resentments on the table that never reached a path of understanding and sometimes when you learn that maladjusted interiors of your shell is something that has bound you. You may or may not find complete peace there. But sometimes when the voices outside listen a little less, one learns to speak with themselves submerged in their own loneliness.</p>

<p>Praising it like a religion that you practice each day, this affect became a ritual when the teacher told you the importance of self expression, but you came across a duality each day. Whether it was your father who said ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to those half questions that started with ‚ÄúMay I..?‚Äù, whether it was your friends who thought that you seem comfortable with everything that they forgot to look at you, thereafter, whether it was your loved one who thought that when I say that, ‚ÄúI enjoy loneliness‚Äù, I was just hoping that he could fight for me this one time. But he laughed a little.</p>

<p>I know there is a sense of comfort that each of us find in solitude. A solitude that some find in bookstores or in the corner of your L-shaped sofa and some others find it in their beds after a long day. But what if somebody gets too comfortable with solitude? 
It is scary to see how loneliness sometimes spreads like a plague all over your existence. And your body that becomes a host to it‚Äôs finest impressions of being strong, gets comfortable. It‚Äôs scary how it inhabits so deeply in your heart that you now don‚Äôt shine when people knock at the doors. It‚Äôs scary how it becomes our skin, and we get so comfortable with it each day.</p>

<p>I know there is a balance in solitude. I hope that each one of you embrace that solitude.
I want you to be comfortable in your skin infront of others as much as you gain confidence in being comfortable with it yourself. I want you to be aware of a light that is found in each varied relationship, you just need patience for it to flourish, not perish.</p>
