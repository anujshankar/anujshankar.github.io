<p>Love, was the letter L that came after you did a match with your crush through the game of FLAMES back in school. Maybe, the love would stay you thought, because both of your names would never change and the count of 7 would always prove that love was bound to happen.</p>

<p>Love, was the smile on your face when you looked at him. You knew it was different from your normal smile, because you had read somewhere that while in love you smile a little more deeply. It was the electric rush found by holding his hands. Yes, you indeed felt your cheeks go red. Hoping, that maybe. Just maybe, he was feeling the same.</p>

<p>Love was catching a glimpse in the morning assemblies or while passing through the corridor. Love was saving the seat in the bus till the time somebody inquired about that seat. Because after all, he forwarded a text that read as “10 signs that you’re in love”.</p>

<p>Love, was that person who remembered each detail about you, it was the same person who was interested to listen to your plan A, B, C and even more not because he wanted to please it with a reply, but because he was shaping his plans accordingly, it was the 2:00 am conversations at night where everyone was asleep but you were awake as if discovering him was an adventure, love was the number of things that you wanted to tell him but you can’t because if you answer the question without him raising the question, he might think that he did the right thing by not asking you the question, love was when you wanted to hold onto him despite any circumstance, love was in his voice that made the same rigmarole of daily conversations, love was wishing for him, love was being comforted in each other’s silence, love now came with excitement only wrapped under a sense of comfort.</p>

<p>Love was when you looked at him and you never thought about how you wanted anything else. Because, in that moment you had everything you wanted. It was under the same person who managed to increase your heartbeat and also soften it bit by bit. 
And honestly, if you’ve found this, that is best way to know that you’re in love.</p>
